READ_ME

Steps to running my program:
1. INPUT FILE MUST END IN A BLANK NEW LINE TO PRINT ENTIRE OUTPUT FILE.
2. Ensure there is an input file titled "input.txt"
3. Run "gcc homework2.c"
4. Run "./a.out"
5. This will generate 3 files.
6. The new lines on the clean input file work properly on Windows but the
method I used to detect new lines does not seem to work on Linux. No newlines.
7. Must have empty line at the end of the input.txt
8. input.txt must have proper spacing.
